Most of this is borrowed code that I'm pushing to my GitHub since I switch 
between systems a lot. Credit for the majority of this goes to Heath Adams, 
a wonderful cybersecurity and penetration testing instructor that frankly 
teaches better than any university instructor I've come across. 
Any new code that I custom create will be annotated as such. 

The two "spk" files are to be used in the command line on Kali. After you've 
enumerated your target and found a service that is potentially susceptible to 
a buffer overflow exploit, "spike" the service using a format similar to these
files. 
Afterwards, fuzz the service using "fuzz.py". This is a work in progress and I 
will be tweaking it as necessary.
